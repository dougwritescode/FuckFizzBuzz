# FuckFizzBuzz

Oh, you wanna FizzBuzz?

Well, I can't speak for all programmers, but I can say, for myself, FUCK FizzBuzz.

Every time, it's always Fizz Buzz.

No variety, no other problems or areas of development competency come up first -- not OOP, not different paradigms, not testing practices (maybe binary trees, but FizzBuzz usually comes first).

With that in mind, maybe if I implement FizzBuzz on my own enough, and with sufficient variety, interviewers will stop fucking asking to whiteboard this CS-100-level problem and actually try to challenge themselves to learn from the interview process, too.
